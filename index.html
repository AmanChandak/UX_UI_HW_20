I found myself losing focus on the main goal of this project as I went through the phases, which was safety. I had the idea that Infinity would be an application that focused on COVID-19 safety and I spent too much time on all the other features instead of that one. It wasn’t until I defined the minimum viable product of Infinity that I was able to start making any progress. I had to go back and iterate a lot of my work from the previous phases but I learned that that is all part of the design process. 

Better Competitive Analysis
I realized later on that a lot of the existing travel apps are adapting to the COVID-19 safety structure , which I thought wasn’t the case and would make Infinity one of a kind. I ended up pulling a lot of inspiration from Expedia to create my app, and built the structure of Infinity around that. 

New Discoveries 
I was amazed how fast an idea turned into a prototype even after knowing very little about UX design. I felt like I was making mistake after mistake and there were times where I thought I couldn’t fix it. However, after much guidance from teachers and peers I was able to put together a project I am happy with, and I feel like the challenge was all worth it. I have learned a lot and I am excited to move forward, make more mistakes, and continue the learning process.

Finale
I have learned how to think differently and creatively throughout this project, and it will help me improve my design process in future projects.
